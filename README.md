# 27MHz-using-AX5043
Very rough, preliminary routine running on 458MHz to test out Arduino Nanos connected to the AX5043. No data has been sent yet from TX to RX. My thanks to Jonathan (C-3PO) for all his help and to the author of:

The hardware has been tried on 27 Mhz. It transmits, but no PLL lock yet. Tweaking output circuit?
