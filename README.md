# 27MHz & 458MHz-using-AX5043
Preliminary routine to test out Arduino Nano connected to the AX5043.  My thanks to Jonathan (C-3PO) for all his help and to the author of:

The TX is set for ON for 8 secs and OFF for 2 secs. 
7 July. Latest version PLL locks OK and transmits on 27  MHz CB radio) band. Antenna matching circuit from:
https://www.onsemi.com/forum/t/faq-how-to-operate-ax5043-at-27-mhz-custom-matching-networks-for-ax5043/274
But TX circuit does not transmit on full power. (Module current about 2mA, should be about 50mA from data sheet.)
Still not sent any data or transmitted at usable power.
